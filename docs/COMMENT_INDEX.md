# HyperLeaf Comment Index

Canonical asset-evaluation discussion: [issue #7](https://github.com/HyperLeafHQ/HyperLeaf/issues/7). Do not use closed PR #4 as the live index.

## Canonical evaluation series

Only formal asset evaluations receive a numbered `#NN`. Watchlist / No-Go / Already Exists / batch-screening records do not consume a new number unless explicitly promoted. Existing-number corrections are made in-place.

| # | Asset / evaluation | Preferred representation / direction | Status | Comment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #00 | Methodology / canonical index | Gate 0 + productive-position framework | Canonical index | [5609277559](https://github.com/HyperLeafHQ/HyperLeaf/issues/7#issuecomment-5609277559) |
| #01–#42 | Existing canonical series | See canonical #00 index | Existing records | [Issue #7](https://github.com/HyperLeafHQ/HyperLeaf/issues/7) |
| #43 | CFX / Conflux | Native CFX PoS productive position; bridge to HyperEVM only through a verified canonical route | Selected / P1 Research / Production Gated | TBD |

## Numbering reconciliation

- **#40 = MON / shMON**, **#41 = LUNC**, **#42 = XTZ / Tezos**, **#43 = CFX / Conflux**.
- Old EURC `#89` is retired and is not part of the formal evaluation series.
- MON / shMON is one consolidated record with the existing `hshMON` implementation; do not create another MON evaluation.
- LUNC legacy WLUNC has official historical Terra/Shuttle provenance, but this does **not** establish a current canonical Terra Classic → HyperEVM deployment.
- Tezos' official XTZ → Etherlink route is canonical for Etherlink, not for HyperEVM.

## Non-series completed / consolidated evaluations

| Asset | Decision | Comment |
|---|---|---|
| KITE / Kite AI | Strong Watch / Strategic Candidate; agent-payment infrastructure + PoS staking; observation only until canonical KITE → HyperEVM representation, productive accounting, liquidity and exits are verified. | [5639822315](https://github.com/HyperLeafHQ/HyperLeaf/issues/7#issuecomment-5639822315) |
| STREAM / Streamflow | Strong Watch / Strategic Candidate; real Solana infrastructure, protocol revenue and staking/governance utility, but no current canonical STREAM → HyperEVM route and no direct claim on protocol revenue. Observation only. | [5653220142](https://github.com/HyperLeafHQ/HyperLeaf/issues/7#issuecomment-5653220142) |
| LDO | No-Go / Watchlist as standalone Leaf; prefer stETH/wstETH or productive Lido position | 5637940642 |
| BTT | P1 Research Candidate / native BTTC staking; canonical HyperEVM route required | 5637959434 |
| GNO | P1 Strategic Candidate; do not implement yet | 5638008710 |
| PI | Watchlist / No-Go; no standalone Leaf | 5630142069 |
| FLR | P1 Research Candidate; intentionally non-numbered | Historical standalone evaluation |

## CFX evaluation

CFX qualifies for a formal HyperLeaf evaluation because it has a native protocol-level productive position: Conflux PoS staking. Conflux documents staking rewards and a 13-day lock followed by a 1-day normal unlock after unstake; early exit can extend waiting up to 14 days.

Conflux has Core Space for native staking and eSpace for EVM-compatible execution. CrossSpace provides an official Core/eSpace CFX transfer mechanism, but an unstaked eSpace CFX balance is not a staking position.

Conflux publicly announced Stargate support for CFX transfers involving Conflux eSpace, Ethereum, HyperEVM and Kaia in November 2025. This establishes an operational CFX → HyperEVM route, but not a native Hyperliquid canonical asset deployment. The exact HyperEVM token, custody, bridge and exit topology therefore remain production gates.

Preferred architecture: `CFX → Core PoS staking position → verified exit/unlock → canonical bridge route → HyperEVM Leaf`. A mature canonical rate-bearing staking receipt would be preferred if one becomes available.

Do not represent unstaked eSpace CFX as staked backing. Do not treat CFX price appreciation as yield. Separate staking rewards from inflation, incentives, market price and bridge liquidity.

Decision: **Selected / P1 Research / Production Gated.** Production requires verification of Core staking custody, reward accounting, validator/slashing behavior, Core → eSpace → HyperEVM exit topology, exact HyperEVM token/bridge contracts, bridge failure recovery and capped solvency against verified economically realizable NAV.

## Methodology

1. Market / protocol discovery
2. Gate 0 — HyperEVM canonicality
3. Canonical asset identity
4. Productive position
5. Canonical backing
6. Accounting unit
7. Yield taxonomy
8. Exit topology
9. Admin / upgrade / custody trust
10. HyperEVM demand
11. HyperLeaf differentiation
12. Leaf class
13. Solvency invariant
14. ABI / fork / on-chain verification
15. Final decision
16. Implementation requirements

Core rule: productive position > spot-token wrapping. `totalLeafLiability <= verified economically realizable NAV of productive position`.

Keep Backing / Yield / Incentives / Market Price / Exit Value separate. Unverified appreciation must never create Leaf liabilities.
